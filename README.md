# KARRPOS-ROM
-- Kustom Android Remote Rich Prjkt OS - ROM 
<br>
-- I started this idea about having a custom rom back in 2014-15, but I dindt have enaugh knowledge about how to make a custom rom and how to root devices or flashing custom recoveries ,,, etc..
<br>
-- And now I have some knowledge about android and Linux / Windows /Windows 10 Mobile and so on other OSs like iOS and its structure, how they works , where is its bugs, (exploitable features) and they cons or pros about having this and this OS... 
<br>
-- I learned a lot about Linux/UNIX/Android ... and windows stuff to possibly create a functional working system like its KARRP-OS-ROM
<br>
# About KARRP-OS-ROM (shortly KARP)
<br>
# K-ustom <br>
-- Kustomizable like other Android ROMs (like EvolutionXOS,RR--ResurrectionRemixOS...etc...)
<br>
# A-ndroid  <br>
-- based on android Kernel / Lib. as its default bcs I just dont want to experiment with Linux build OS (distro) , I just wanted some OS that will work on ARM based devices natively , and linux is harder to use for BFU users so I decided to switch from LinuxKARP(KLRP) to Android-BasedKARP(KARP)...
<br>
# R-emote  <br>
-- I always wanted to have my stuff with me on the road everywhere ... like it on Cloud-Based OS or Android device / Laptop(Linux/Windows) and so dont have to switch between other OSses.. and always have ONE main OS on the road so I can (be /will) connect like to  my Oracle Cloud-Based Ubuntu machine and have my stuff here, and it will be synced (docs, pictures/imgs, or videos) with my mobile device or even laptop (--devices will run KARP, to be succesfull to sync stuff)... now I wondering that I have very bad English I am using... sorry for that (I am just from Czechia..)
<br>
# R-ich <br>
-- under this term i imagine a RICH support of / on varius devices this OS can run, if u remember that the Microsoft want to have they're OS(Windows/Windows10Mobile) everywhere "fully" working on like mobile devices, laptops, PCs and wearables but it didn't catch on very well this - the're plan and Microsoft has since then problems with implementing the're OS on ARM like devices, but the're trying to do so(/it).. --> but remember Windows is not OPSCR(open-source) so it will be closed for some tweaking or end-user debugging ...and so on ,
<br>
-- so I wanted some OPSCR OS like its Android /Linux but it will be Cross-Platform(ARM / AMD64 / I386 --for 32bit, who thF uses 32bit in 2023..., anyways...)and it will be in future dominating the OS market ... that CAN OFFER END-USER / DEV what he longs for, and thats it: everything (synced) on ONE device, ONE cloud and ONE system, thats for everythingthey're need, so they didn't do to switch between Windows-Android-iOS or Linux-Android-iOS ...and reversed so on...
<br>
# P-roject <br>
-- about prjkt: The prjkt is just for fun , I decided to do it bcs I just wanted and its not a School-prjkt or Work-prjkt, as I said I wanted to do it OPEN-SOURCE (OPSCR) that everyone can "experimenting" with the OS-ROM / build newer versions / patch bugs / improve some stuff in Kernel,System and Custom Recovery for KARRP(KARP) / update system / port to other devices which arent natively supportde (bcs I just have a small part of devices taht I can use it(Like "Xiaomi-Mi-8-dipper", Samsung-Galaxy-s6-Edge/S7/S8Pus/S20FE--FanEdition/M21/j5-2016", "Lenovo-Vibe-X2-EU", "Lenovo-Tab-4-10", "Lenovo-M10-FHD-REL-3-32",("Lumia-550/950XL") ..and other device taht I use)...

<h2>Deeply into the KARRP-OS-ROM ( KARP )</h2>
# started by date
-- I started by 13.3.2023 , building and designing this OS/ROM , currently in Alpha version(so there is some bugs and not-working-properly things and other cons in the OS/ROM itself..)
<br>
-- I am planning to create an Beta-testing stage by year 2025
<br>
# Features of KARRP(KARP)<br>
-- in future I plan to add features like "Samsung-DEX" -- which is curreently on small part of devices like S, NOTE (S20-FE...,NOTE-8) series, but its not supported on series like M(M21...), A(..A7),J(J5-2016)... the "pc-mode" will be called "KARRP(KARP)-DEX --> KARRP(KARP) DesktopEXperience" --which will be also OPSCR like other stuff in the OS/ROM<br>
-- OPSCR drivers (for sensors like "flashlight", "camera", "LUX/Light-sensor", "Proximity-sensor" "Gyro-Accelerom-Barom-sensors", "USB" idk what else next so...)<br>
-- OPSCR firmware(which can be flashable via OrangFOX /TWRP /CWM Custom Recovery)<br>
-- OPSCR OS/ROM<br>
-- OPSCR-DEX--DesktopEXperience -- "pc-mode"<br>
***More about PC-mode feature:<br>
-- if device is >6" (over 6 inch ) it will do : "the "pc-mode" can do ..if device is plugged into HDMI cable it will shows-up and KARRP(KARP)DEX mode on external monitor/ display and also if device is not connected to external monitor/ display via HDMI cable and meets the req. like ">6inch" it can display / switch to KARRP(KARP)DEX and display this mode on it-self<br>
-- if device doesn meet the req. like bigger screen ">6inch" it can display "pc-mode" externally, but not internally --> this can be turned ON in "secret" menu that // where u can change the DPI of external / internal display or as i said before turn of feature "SMALL-SCREEN(on/off)" and display on ur small device like 4.7" or 5" an display-DEX-pc-mode" .. which I dont recomeded it bcs it small and harder to click on icons ...but i can make it accessible to everyone that wants to try it<br>
